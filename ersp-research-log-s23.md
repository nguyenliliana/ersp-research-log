# LILIANA'S RESEARCH LOG - SPRING '23

This research log is meant for me to record my learning and research progress. 

# Week 1

**Wed April 4: Group Meeting, Round 3 Experiments, Paper Introduction**

Group Meeting: 
- Did Round 3 of Experiments
- Results looked good, but want to experiment with the prompting strategy more to see if we can get better results

Prompting Strategy: 
- Trying to make prompt generation more consistent and work for a variety of user prompts
- I am working on my previous approach, but experimenting with different combinations of exemplars to see if it results in better performance
- Ended with 8 versions of the prompting strategy I've been working on. The last one which is #8 without the negative prompt. I realized I liked the quality and accuracy of the images, but the combination of the two examples I used for this one ended having the same negative prompts, so I decided to exclude it. The generated images are high quality and excel at accuracy. I would like to run a ranking experiment with this one.

Paper Introduction: 
- I drafted the paper introduction based on the outline we wrote as a group.

**Mon April 3: Group Meeting, Round 2 Experiments**

Group Meeting: 
- Generated results from Round 2 of Experiments
- Results were not satisfactory
- Need to experiment with prompting strategy more, especially with Hugo's which seems the most promising right now
