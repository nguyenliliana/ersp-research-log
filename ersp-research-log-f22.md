**Sunday (0.5 hours) Research Paper Prep**
 - I read and took notes on _[How to Read an Engineering Research Paper](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html)_ using a Google Doc. I organized the key parts of the article that I would want to reference later on when I read a research paper such as the essential questions and tips.  I found that the article was helpful in preparing me to read a research paper efficiently.

**Monday (1.5 hours) Log Set Up & Reflection 1**
To set up my research log, I chose to do it in a github repo since it can be best organized with my other CS projects.  I also think it would be a good chance for me to become familiar with using Markdown.  

**Tuesday (0.25 hours) CS110/ERSP Contract & Study Consent Form**
I read and signed the ERSP contract and Study Consent form with the PDF editor Kami and submitted it to Gauchospace. 

*Initial Thoughts on ERSP*
> What I am most excited about in ERSP. 

I am excited to apply my skills in a professional research setting.  I haven't had enough professional experience where I was able to utilize my programming skills to its potential, so I'm excited to learn a lot from working in labs with a team and with faculty members.  I look forward to working with AI, ML, and NLP concepts for the first time and cultivating new skills in this area.  

> What I am most nervous about in ERSP. 

I'm nervous about not being able to contribute to the research project as well as my teammates.  I definitely will not lack in effort and determination, but my wish is to be a reliable and active team member that is able to contribute to the project in many different ways.  I will be sure to stay motivated this quarter and prepare myself by learning the related skills and attend CS 165B as recommended.

*Log Reflection*

I was impressed by how organized and detailed the logs were.  Tony and Jacqueline both used Github for their research logs, so their format looked very similar.  Tony used more checkmarks where as Jacqueline used more bullet points.  Miranda used google sites so she is able to make her headers, subheaders, and parts look more distinct and thus easier to read.  I think the logs are useful for researchers to keep track of their progress especially when you set weekly goals and keep track of your accomplishments.  The detailed logs are helpful for the researcher to look back on but also educational for others who read the journal to see and understand what happened throughout the 10 weeks.  It's impressive to see how they accomplish their goals each week, and set higher goals for the next week each time.
