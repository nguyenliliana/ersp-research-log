# LILIANA'S RESEARCH LOG - WINTER '23

This research log is meant for me to record my learning and research progress. 

## Week 5

**Wed Feb 8: Mentor Meeting- Share Results & Feedback**

After sharing the results, we agreed that one example is not enought and that more demonstrations are needed to teach ChatGPT.

Experiment With: 
1. Giving a before and after or good and bad comparison that explains what changes were made to create a good prompt. 
2. Do more demonstrations with explanation of generating good prompt. 
3. What ChatGPT knows and Stable Diffusion knows are different. For example, with the phrase, "slice bread", ChatGPT can infer that slicing is done with a knife, but if that is not specified to the Stable Diffusion model, then it will not generate a knife in the image. How can we bridge this gap? How can we teach ChatGPT the abilties/limitations of Stable Diffusion. 
4. How can we TRANSLATE human prompts with ChatGPT to be a suitable prompt for Stable Diffusion to understand. 

Task: 
1. Run same experiment of 20 prompts using more demonstrations. 

**Tues Feb 7: Group Meeting- Evaluate Images & Analyze Data**


We each generated images with 4 human prompts and ChatGPT-generated prompts. The Stable Diffusion model generates 4 images for each prompt. The 4 images from the human prompt and the 4 images from the ChatGPT prompt were organized on a single slide in random order, then the evaluators ranked the 8 images from best to worst by prompt relevancy.

I coded a program on Colab using Python and Pandas Dataframe to process our data to see which images ranked the highest, human or ChatGPT prompts. However, there a few bugs I need to fix. We used my teammates program to generate the following results:

[Results](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sTEZddQdgxiaxVnKF13IPFYWU6l8gwv8PrVOZBry3yA/edit?usp=sharing)

From the results, we came to an understanding that one example is not enough. The ChatGPT-generated prompts do not follow the ideal prompt format outlined in the prompt book. In addition, the ChatGPT prompts vary immensely depending on the original prompt that the user inputs. 

**Mon Feb 6: Mentor Meeting**

We presented our[Research Outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BLhkD2DzUr9ck6EBEAwrdXmzzBvtF9M6HpePg_gwQEg/edit?usp=sharing) to our mentors. 

Meeting Takeaways: 
1. Evaluating the images by ranking them is a good idea. We need to decide the criteria(s) to rank with: image quality, object indentifiability, and prompt relevancy are a few ideas. 
2. Task: Generate 20 prompts with ChatGPT and compare them to the human-made prompts. For this round of experimenting with ChatGPT, we only explained the task, the prompt format, and one example to ChatGPT before asking for a prompt. 
3. With the Chain-of-Thought approach, ChatGPT does a good job at understanding the different features of a prompt, so it's able to take information from the user input and infer the features that would suit it, making the prompt more detailed which I thought was good. However, our mentor raises the question about whether the prompt generated from ChatGPT is simply better because it has more details, and if so, would it make a fair comparison to the original prompt? I think our goal is more so to translate a typical user's prompt to a prompt that is more suited and understandable for the Stable Diffusion model. 

**Sun Feb 5: Brainstorm Ways to Evaluate Image Generation**

I read [Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09983.pdf) which discusses current strategies to evaluate text-to-image synthesis models. They explained metrics like R-precision, VS Similarity, Captioning Metrics, and Semantic Object Accuracy. However, User Evaluation is the best since humans are abel to evaluate image quality, image diversity, object fidelity, text relevance, mentioned objects, and positional alignment. 

As a result of my reading, I will probably have my group stick with human evaluations. 

I also watched the video [Images as Data: Best practices for storing and organizing your research images](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlVj3U01UeY&ab_channel=DigitalScholarshipHub-McGillUniversity). The workshop provides useful strategies on managing and organizing research images. They introduced the image management software Tropy, a free open-source software that allows users to organize and describe photographs of research material. I will try out this software and see if it would be useful for my research.

## Week 4
**Sat Feb 2: Experiment With Chain-of-Thought and Traditional Explanation Approach on ChatGPT**

[Chain-of-Thought](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_NPT-HjAvyftwLCw-PQQaEWw9XjZz9y43KYsArF2RO0/edit?usp=sharing)
Chain-of-Thought teaches the language model in a Q & A+Explanation format. For the explanation, I decided to define each part of the prompt. I think that ChatGPT understood this very well, and with a simple prompt input, it generates a new prompt that is much more detailed and in a format suited for a stable diffusion model. 

[Traditional Explanation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YwU35PStXOOcBS0bK4MbHqWsoK0Nl6hTa-f6TwS3wJg/edit?usp=sharing)

**Fri Feb 3: Research Outline**

I worked on a [research outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WkwLcFZPeCvPqvG-_D_xceiKCzw3hMaTZt9TrItFYZQ/edit?usp=sharing) to present to our mentors. It outlines our understanding of the research question and task, the different experimental approaches we are considering, and questions we want to explore. 

**Thurs Feb 2: ChatGPT API**

1. I experimented with using a [ChatGPT API](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT) to automate our inputs and the responses. For the browserless version, I am running into an error saying that the model doesn't exist. I will try using a different API key to see if this gets fixed. I also tried using the Browser version, where I am running into many issues with getting the chrome driver to work. The chromedriver unexpectedly exits with status code -6 or there is an UnboundLocalError: local variable 'driver' referenced before assignment.
2.  I also tried following this [blog](https://blog.nextideatech.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-with-python/). It was a simple approach and seemed to work, but on my first try, the error message said, "You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details. So it appears that this approach is not completely free like the first approach. 
3.  Lastly, I tried following this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3okwVkxDgA&ab_channel=1littlecoder). I get the same issue of the chromedriver unexpectedly exiting with status code -6.

**Wed Feb 1: Group Meeting, New Resarch Topic!**

 Group Meeting w/ Prof. Chang and Mentors: 
 - After discussing about our goals to write a paper for EMNLP, our Prof. Chang and our mentors decided to choose a research topic that would be more feasible with our timeline. Thus, our new research question is the following: 
 - Stable Diffusion 2.1 is the latest text-to-image model from StabilityAI. It takes in a prompt and generates four images. However, writing a detailed and accurate prompt can prove to be difficult and time consuming. While humans can try our best to predict what prompt works best for our intended image, machines may be better at recognizing underlying patterns to the prompts that better communicate to the stable diffusion model what image to generate. ChatGPT is a conversational language model developed by OpenAI. It uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. ChatGPT is trained on a large corpus of text data and can be used for various natural language processing tasks such as text generation. How can we make the process of making prompts easier by utilizing ChatGPTâ€™s learning and adaptive abilities to train it to write prompts? 

**Tues Jan 31: Brainstorm, Group Meeting**

Group Meeting: 
1. Went over assignment from mentors where we experimented with a Stable Diffusion model. Our goal was to give it a detailed prompt that would give us a New Year greeting card with a bunny on it. 
2. Discussed our opinions on writing a short paper for a deadline coming up in a month. The paper would most likely be a proposal of an idea or implementation that we have in mind. We will need to ask our mentors and advisor about this. 

Obstacles: 
1. When running program (2), my program still runs out of RAM. I have figured out that it crashes while loading the fine-tuned BARG model since it isn't loading it into the GPU memory. 

Questions for (2): 
1. Why freeze the token and positional embeddings in the summarization model? 

Brainstorm: 
1. How do I train an NLU model to check for answer correctness? 
2. Is building the tri-module system we were thinking about something that can be considered research or make a decent research paper? 
3. Can we go about generalizing the QAG system to other more difficult text like history textbooks or biology textooks? 

**Mon Jan 30: Brainstorm**

Brainstorm: 
1. Can we generalize the QAG model to history or science books? What technical changes or improvements would we need? How would we go about getting/making a quality annotated data set? 
2. Is there a need to improve the question quality/diversity that Yao's model currently achieves? What improvements to answer extraction, question generation, and filtering would we need?
3.  How are the heuristics rule passed and followed by the system? 
4.  Would the system currenly be able to generate more complex questions like the causes and effects of a historical event if we were to fine-tune it on a certain data set? 

## Week 3
**Sat Jan 28: Finished Pre-Processing Data, Attempt to Fine-Tune BART QG**

Readings: 
1. [How to generate text: using different decoding methods for language generation with Transformers](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate)

Progress: 
1. (0) After adding the code to write the train split into the files, I finished preprocessing the data and saved it to my Google Drive. I will need to check with my teammates and mentors about whether the changes I made to the code are correct. Also, my processed data looks different than the preprocessed data that is provided in the [GitHub](https://github.com/WorkInTheDark/FairytaleQA_QAG_System), so I will have to check if I did it correctly. 
2. (1) I began to fine-tune the BART QG model, but the program only ran for about an hour until a process error is called: 'died with <Signals.SIGKILL:9>'

Stuck On: 
1. Fixing process error while fine-tuning BART QG model. 
2. Running out of RAM when trying to generate QA pairs with QAG system. 

**Fri Jan 27: Readings, Preprocessed Data and Began to Fine-Tune BART QG**

Readings: 
1. [End-to-End Synthetic Data Generation for Domain Adaptation of Question Answering Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06028.pdf)

Progress: 
1. (0) I read through and annotated the code to understand what preprocessing was being done. I preprocessed data for Finetuning BART QG. Files include test.source, test.target, val.source. val.target. I was confused as to why there wasn't code to write the processed training data to a file, but I realized that I could just write that missing part myself, so I will be doing that tomorrow. 
2. (1) I was able to start fine-tuning BART QG with the preprocessed data that the GitHub repo provided. I fixed imports and file paths. Due to time constraints, I will continue this tomorrow. 
3. (2) I fixed import errors and file paths. I was able to get everything to run until my runtime crashed due to running out of RAM. I may need to upgrade my Colab. 

**Wed Jan 25: Begin to Replicate Yao's QAG System**

Progress:
1. Started looking through the files in the GitHub. Read through most of the code and tried to understand it.
2. Met with mentor Yujian to discuss timeline for potential paper and any confusions with my readings. 


**Tue Jan 24: Readings**

Readings: 
1. [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2014/file/a14ac55a4f27472c5d894ec1c3c743d2-Paper.pdf) 
2. [BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation, Translation, and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461.pdf)
3. [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf)

## Week 2

**Mon Jan 16: Learn Linear Regression and Gradient Descent**

I watched Andrew Ng YouTube videos on linear regression and gradient descent as part of his Machine Learning series. 

> Takeaways:
  
  1. Have some function J(Î¸<sub>0</sub>, Î¸<sub>1</sub>) and want min<sub>Î¸<sub>0</sub>, Î¸<sub>1</sub></sub> J(Î¸<sub>0</sub>, Î¸<sub>1</sub>)
  2. Start with some Î¸<sub>0</sub>, Î¸<sub>1</sub>
  3. Keep changing Î¸<sub>0</sub>, Î¸<sub>1</sub> to reduce J(Î¸<sub>0</sub>, Î¸<sub>1</sub>) until we end at minimum.

**Tue Jan 17: Model Training**

I learned how to load datsets as PyTorch tensors using the torchtext Field and TabularDataset. Batches are created with BucketIterator. I employ the BERT architecture with a single additional layer for output prediction with the class BERTNLIModel. The constructor initializes with bert, hidden dimension, and output dimension. The forward pass of the model gets embedded representation of the input and applies a linar layer 'self.out' to map it to the output. 

**Fri Jan 20: Mentor Meeting**


## Week 1

**Wed Jan 11: Review BERT**

I watched videos first to get an overview of how BERT and Transformers work. Then, I read articles to get a technical understanding. 

> Takeaway: BERT is made up of stacked encoders from transformer architect as per the name, Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer

**Thu Jan 12: Understand NLI Task**

My mentors challenged my group to finetune pre-trained BERT model to do sentence pair classification with the MultiNLI dataset. 

> Takeaways:
1. Load BERT model and attach an additional layer for classification
2. Process and transform sentence-pair data for task
3. Fine-tune BERT model for sentence pair classification

**Fri Jan 13: Preprocess MNLI Dataset**

I set up the colab, importing necessary modules like torchtext and pandas. I imported the MNLI dataset and organized it into a dataframe using pandas. I extracted the necessary columns to prepare for preprocessing. 

Columns after preprocessing: 
1. gold_label
2. sequence: \[cls] sentence 1 \[sep] sentence 2 \[sep]
3. attention mask: \[1] * len(sentence) --> string
4. token type:  \[0] * len(sentence) +  \[1] * len(sentence) --> string
